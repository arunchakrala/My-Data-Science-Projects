1. Using housing data to predict the price of a house using various potential predictor variables.
2. The first step involves in reading and understanding the data using Python
3. Then visualizing the data to identify any trends or patterns and prepare the data for modelling
4. The model was build using bottom-up approach. i.e, starting with one variable and adding potential variables one by one until we reach the ideal model accuracy
5. The problem was tackled with multiple linear regression using Python Pandas, Sklearn, and statsmodels packages and libraries
