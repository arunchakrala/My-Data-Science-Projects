# Using housing data to predict the price of a house using various potential predictor variables.
# The first step involves in reading and understanding the data using Python
# Then visualizing the data to identify any trends or patterns and prepare the data for modelling
# The model was build using bottom-up approach. i.e, starting with one variable and adding potential variables one by one until we reach the ideal model accuracy
# The problem was tackled with multiple linear regression using Python Pandas, Sklearn, and statsmodels packages and libraries
